"I have a very hard time with trying to find a job, from most places I don't get any feedbacks, but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company.

"Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.",1,grad school really easy place parent alone assistantship pay enough live mine net little less month rent let alone tiny human need particular type education also require commit hour week campus work essentially mean really hold full time job anywhere top work another part time become difficult work hour coincide hour little one school hour week campus already leave little time actually work anywhere else school hour
